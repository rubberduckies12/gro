9. TREE PLANTING PROGRAM
9.1 Program Description
For every £100 you invest through Gro, we plant one tree through Just One Tree (https://www.justonetree.life/), our environmental partner organization.
Calculation Examples:

Invest £50 = 0.5 trees (rounded to nearest tree after multiple contributions)
Invest £250 = 2 trees planted
Invest £1,000 = 10 trees planted
Invest £10,000 = 100 trees planted

Trees are tracked cumulatively across all your contributions.
9.2 Tree Planting Process and Timeline

Trees are counted based on total invested amount (after service fees)
Tree planting occurs within 6 months from your contribution date
Trees are planted in batches to optimize logistics and align with appropriate planting seasons
You can track your tree count and planting status via the Platform
Tree planting is managed by Just One Tree and their global reforestation partners
Planting locations vary based on current reforestation needs and Just One Tree's active projects worldwide

9.3 Environmental Impact Tracking
Your Impact Dashboard displays:

Total number of trees planted from your investments
Planting status (pending, scheduled, planted, confirmed)
Expected planting date (within 6 months of contribution)
Estimated CO₂ offset (in tonnes)
Global map showing general planting regions via Just One Tree
Cumulative environmental impact over time
Annual impact summary reports

9.4 Environmental Impact Calculations
CO₂ offset and environmental impact calculations are estimates based on:

Average tree species carbon sequestration rates (typically 20-30kg CO₂ per year per tree)
Tree survival rates and maturity projections
Just One Tree's environmental research and data
Regional climate and ecosystem factors

Important Disclaimers:

These are good-faith estimates based on Just One Tree's methodology, not guarantees of actual environmental impact
Actual carbon sequestration varies by species, location, climate, and tree survival
Impact projections assume successful tree establishment and long-term growth
We rely on Just One Tree's verification and reporting processes

9.5 Program Funding
The Tree Planting Program is funded exclusively from our 5% service fee on contributions. Tree planting costs are not deducted separately from your investment amount.
9.6 Just One Tree Partnership
Just One Tree is our environmental partner responsible for:

Coordinating global tree planting initiatives
Working with verified local planting organizations
Monitoring tree survival and growth
Providing impact reporting and verification
Ensuring trees are planted in areas of genuine reforestation need
Completing tree planting within 6 months of our funding allocation

You can learn more about Just One Tree's mission and projects at https://www.justonetree.life/

We reserve the right to:

Change the tree planting ratio (currently 1 tree per £100) with 90 days' advance notice
Extend the 6-month planting timeline in exceptional circumstances (natural disasters, extreme weather, political instability in planting regions)
Modify or change partner organizations if Just One Tree becomes unavailable or unsuitable
Adjust the program structure based on operational feasibility and costs
Discontinue the program entirely with 180 days' notice (trees already committed will still be planted)

Any changes to the program will be communicated clearly via email and in-app notifications.

The 6-month planting timeline may be extended in cases of:

Natural disasters affecting planting regions
Seasonal restrictions (certain trees can only be planted during specific months)
Political instability or safety concerns in planned planting locations
Force majeure events beyond Just One Tree's control

You will be notified if your tree planting is delayed beyond 6 months, with an updated expected planting date.

The Tree Planting Program is a corporate initiative funded by Gro Equity Ltd's service fees, not your direct contributions.
Important:

Trees planted on your behalf do not constitute tax-deductible charitable contributions by you
You cannot claim tax deductions or credits for trees planted through the program
The environmental impact is a benefit of using the platform, not a personal charitable donation

9.10 No Ownership Rights or Carbon Credits

You do not own or have any legal interest in trees planted through the program
Trees are planted on land owned or managed by Just One Tree or their partner organizations
You cannot claim carbon credits or offsets for regulatory compliance purposes
Trees cannot be transferred, sold, or assigned to third parties
