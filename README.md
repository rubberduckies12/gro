## 📰 News Flash

<i>Gro launches the first goal-driven investing app that feels like a personal stock!</i>

---

## 🧩 The Problem

Most people don’t have time to cherry-pick stocks or learn financial models.  
The fallback? “Just put it all in the S&P 500.”  
But that’s not personal. It ignores your goals, timeline, and risk comfort.

---

## 💡 The Idea

Gro is your investment assistant that:<br>
• Lets you enter your goals (retirement, house, growth, etc.)<br>
• Runs financial models & simulations (Monte Carlo, Sharpe, CAPM, Graham, Black-Scholes)<br>
• Uses AI to explain results in plain English<br>
• Builds a personalized portfolio (stocks, ETFs, bonds) for you<br>
• You review & confirm before any trades — Gro suggests, you decide
